2021-08-04	Next generation protein structure predictions and genetic variant interpretation	Journal of Molecular Biology	In this review, we review the impact of deep learning protein structure prediction methods such as Alphafold and their less-than-expected impact on the task of genetic variant interpretation owing to the abundance of already available structural data	<b>Gaurav D.

2020-09-08	<i>Shifts in mutation spectra enhance access to beneficial mutations</i>	bioRxiv	In this collaboration, I primarily analysed the evolutionary histories of enzymes involved in determining the mutation spectrum of bacteria and showed that there were a large amount of bias reversal events throughout history in line with expectations from simulations done in the paper	Mrudula Sane, <b>Gaurav D Diwan</b>, Bhoomika A Bhat, Lindi M Wahl, Deepa Agashe (2020).

2016-06-01	Large-effect beneficial synonymous mutations mediate rapid and parallel adaptation in a bacterium	Molecular Biology and Evolution	Here we experimentally evolved six strains of a bacterium containing alleles with varied codon usage of a crucial enzyme and observed that single synonymous mutations alleviated the growth defect by improving two properties of the transcript	Deepa Agashe, Mrudula Sane*, Kruttika Phalnikar*, <b>Gaurav D.
